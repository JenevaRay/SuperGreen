## Description
We wrote this app to meet the need of one of our teammates' desire to have a plant care site.  It has a wealth of information that includes things like what bugs a plant can attract, what soil it grows best in, where it is found naturally, how much sunlight and watering it requires, and even how to prune them.

## Table of Contents
* Index.html                `The main page site, which includes three different functional modes.`
* LICENSE                   `tl;dr: MIT license.`
* README.md                 `Which file?  This file.  The best file, for all the files.`
* assets/css/styles.css     `Where everything is in style.`    
* assets/js/api.js          `where multiple APIs are made accessible`
* assets/js/ui.js           `where information from API meets the DOM`
* assets/js/weather.js      `where weather meets the world, whether or not it can be weathered`

* assets/images             `TODO: full list, and which image is for what.`

## Installation
* Github Pages (you must provide API keys in console)
* `git clone` (you must provide API keys in console as well)
* confidential deployment

## Usage
To use this site, navigate to the `index.html` file.  From there, you can search for various plant names, i.e. `lettuce`.
To get details on a search result, simply click on it.  We'd make it simpler, but...  that would be reading minds.
